🤖 SaRA — Smart AI Research Assistant

SaRA is a personal AI assistant hobby project focused on experimenting with voice, vision, and conversational intelligence using modern AI APIs.

This project is primarily a learning playground where I explore how an always-on, interactive assistant could work in real life — from capturing audio and images to reasoning over them and responding naturally.

⚠️ Important: SaRA is a work in progress.
Features, architecture, and implementation details are evolving continuously.

✨ What SaRA Is About

SaRA is designed to act as a lightweight AI assistant that can:

🎤 Capture voice input

🧠 Send queries to AI APIs (LLMs, speech-to-text, etc.)

🔊 Respond with synthesized speech

📷 Optionally capture images and send them for analysis

🌐 Operate as a network-connected assistant using cloud APIs

🧪 Serve as a testbed for ideas around human–AI interaction

The goal is not to build a production-ready assistant, but to learn, experiment, and iterate.

🛠 Project Status

🚧 Actively under development

🧪 Architecture and hardware choices may change

🧩 Features are added incrementally

📝 Code may be refactored frequently

Some things may be incomplete, unstable, or experimental — that’s expected.

🔍 Motivation

This project exists because I enjoy:

Exploring AI systems end-to-end

Working with hardware + software together

Understanding real-world constraints of voice and vision systems

Building things just to see if they can be built

SaRA is a personal exploration, not a commercial product.

📌 Disclaimer

This is a hobby / experimental project

Not intended for production use

APIs, hardware, and logic are subject to change

Contributions, ideas, and feedback are welcome — but expectations should stay realistic
